# SystemRun
Run app as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
Only use the .msi installer if you don't want it to be fully portable and just want it installed
If you change your mind about portability then just take the app from the installation path. The app itself is portable and works on a USB stick, the installer isn't.
Use .exe if you want a direct portable install
